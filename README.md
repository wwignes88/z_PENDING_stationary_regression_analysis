# z-stationary-regression-analysis (pending)

Regression analysis is about the most widely used tool in data analysis. Stationary implies that how the data changes with time is not being accounted for. This is essentially statistics. 

I follow the book 'Introduction to Probability and Mathematical Statistics' by Bain/ Engelhardt. I've coded a number of examples from chapters 14-15. Most examples in ch 15 have been worked through and coded. Will post soon.
